HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL.

 Set of rules and standards that define how web browsers and web servers communicate with each other. The protocol defines how data is exchanged between client devices (such as web browsers) and server machines over the internet.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, each request/response cycle between a client and server is independent of any previous or subsequent cycles. When a client sends a request to a server using HTTP, the server responds with a message that includes a status code, headers, and a body. The status code indicates whether the request was successful or not, the headers contain additional information about the response, and the body contains the requested data (such as an HTML page, an image, or a JSON object).

The current version of HTTP is HTTP/2, which is an improvement over its predecessor, HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 includes features such as multiplexing, header compression, and server push, which make web browsing faster and more efficient.



Hypertext transfer protocol Agent

- Software component that acts as a CLIENT or SERVER in http communication protocol.

  -As Client:  Http agent SENDS http requests to server and receives Http response from server 
                      :Web browser,command line  (cURL)

 
  -As Server: Http agent LISTENS for incoming  HTTP requests from clients, processes those requests and sends back feedback to the client.
         :Apache Nginx

 -Used as intermediaries between clients and servers to provide additional functionality such as coaching,load balancing  security features (ssl encryption)  


SOOCKET

-Combination of an IP address and a port number that allows two computers to communicate with each other over a network.

-When a client sends an http request to server, it establishes a socket connection with the server,the socket connection is used to transmit the request to the server and receive request from server.


MODULES.
 -inbuilt modules(os,path,filesysytem, http)
 -User defined modules

 Node Package Manager(NPM) - Command-line tools used to manage packages and dependencies for node.js applications.
 - Allows developers to to easily install and manage third-party packages and libraries 


Dependancy- Is a module or package that an application requires to function properly.(External code libraries you need to install or import into your node.js to use fpr functionality)
-Dependancies are stored in the node_modules folder

NPM local Dependancy - Package or module installed locally in a project directory for exclusive use  in the given project
  npm i <packagename>

   Global Dependancy - Use it inany project.
     -npm install -g <packagename>  


-Package.json -Stroes important info about a project/ package(Metadata file that lists various modules and libraries that the project depends on.)
How to create package.json -: Manual approach
                              npm init(step by step)
                              npm init -y (everything default)
